# Image-Synthesis-Flowers

In this project I used Generative Adversarial Neural-Networks to synthesize images of flowers.

## Approach
This is an implementation of a basic GAN. I implemented a discriminator (Binary Classifier) and a Generator (creates images from a random vector).
And then trained both networks simultaneously, By training the discriminator to diffrentiate real images from the fake ones, and updated the generator based on the discriminators feedback.

I created my GAN and trained it from scratch with the help of Keras API.

## Dataset
The training set is Oxfords flowers dataset.


## Text-To-Image (Additional Section)
Additinally, I implemented a Conditional Generative Adversarial Neural Network (CGAN), using Language Models & Convolutional Neural Networks. 

Then trained the model on the same images dataset but with a text discribtion. Below are some of the results and my experiments with it. 
Iâ€™ll show how it extracts semantics from text to create fake images of flowers. The model interprets single colors, as well as combinations of colors to synthesize images of flowers.
